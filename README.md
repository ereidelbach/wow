# Project Description

With the recent launch of World of Warcraft's (WoW) 7th expansion on August 13th, 2018, I personally witnessed a large number of friends returning to Azeroth. While it's been wonderful to see my chat window once again filled with the comforting green text of guild chat, this influx of players caused my mind to drift toward the ramifications for WoW's player base as a whole.

Several years ago Blizzard made the decision to no longer report overall player subscription numbers as part of their quarterly earning reports. Since that time, investors and players alike have been in the dark concerning the overall player trends. Fortunately, the intrepid folks at https://realmpop.com have done their best to keep shining a light on the WoW player population.

Their methods are rather simple, as detailed on their website. In summary, the Realm Pop team records character information for every realm in the US and EU regions by identifying character who post on the auction house, then fetching that person's guild roster, and then recording all players in that guild. Thus, the final recording includes a count of all characters who belong to a guild in which a member has posted an auction. It is expected that this will cover the vast majority of characters, but certainly not all as some players may not utilize the auction house or belong to a guild. It's also important to note that these numbers are reflective of individual characters and not individual accounts (i.e. a single account may have several characters) nor are they reflective of active accounts/characters (i.e. accounts with an active subscription or characters that are actively played).

As this information is updated once a week, I will aspire to maintain that update frequency with this blog to identify trends and/or significant changes in the data.
